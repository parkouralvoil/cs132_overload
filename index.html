					<h2>Overview</h2>
				</header>

				<p>Growing interest in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) in the
					Philippines stems from their advertised fuel efficiency in
					urban environments compared to conventional gasoline cars.
					The Philippine government's Electric Vehicle Industry Development
					Act (EVIDA), offering excise tax exemptions, underscores this
					focus on electric mobility. Our analysis investigates the
					cost-effectiveness of HEVs versus EVs in the National Capital
					Region (NCR), considering current fuel prices and Meralco
					electricity rates, and how major events and subsidies influence
					these costs.
				</p>

				<h3>Background</h3>

				<div class="background_photo">
					<img src="images/ev_photo.jpg" alt="DoE photo" class="responsive-image">
				</div>
				<p>On April 15, 2022, the Philippines enacted EVIDA to
					reduce the country's reliance on imported fossil fuels for
					transportation, support clean energy, and foster
					industrialization<sup>1</sup>. This act encourages the use
					of Electric cars (EVs) by providing benefits such as:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>exemption from number coding schemes<sup>2</sup></li>
					<li>discounts for the Motor Vehicle User's Charge (MVUC) for 8 years<sup>3</sup></li>
					<li>priority registration of special EV license plates<sup>3</sup></li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Problem</h3>
				<p>
					Electric vehicles, powered by electric motors, generally boast
					superior fuel efficiency compared to traditional gasoline cars
					relying on internal combustion engines (ICEs). This might lead
					one to this simple conclusion: EVs are better than ICEs.
					However, the discussion changes when considering vehicles that
					blend these technologies. Hybrid electric cars (HEVs) do this,
					with most using gasoline to generate power for their electric
					motors (and often incorporating both an electric motor and a
					combustion engine).

					<br><br>

					Furthermore, some hybrid models offer the flexibility of external
					charging, much like pure electric cars; these are known as Plug-In
					Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs). HEVs are often marketed for their
					improved fuel economy over conventional ICE vehicles. This raises
					the question: how do they compare against fully electric vehicles
					in terms of cost-effectiveness? Are there scenarios where gasoline
					becomes significantly more economical than electricity, for instance,
					during periods of high electricity demand and potentially higher
					rates, like the dry season in the Philippines? Considering
					the current limitations in public EV charging infrastructure
					within the Philippines, our cost comparison will focus on
					home-based EV charging using Meralco rates versus the cost of
					refueling HEVs at gasoline stations within the National Capital
					Region (NCR).

					<h2>Data</h2>
				</header>

				<p>We gathered most of our data from these sites:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://company.meralco.com.ph/news-and-advisories/rates-archives"
							style="color: green; text-decoration: none;">MERALCO Rates Archive</a>
					</li>
					<li><a href="https://doe.gov.ph/retail-pump-prices-metro-manila"
							style="color: green; text-decoration: none;">NCR Prevailing Retail Pump Prices | Department
							of Energy Philippines</a>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					To scrape the data from the MERALCO Rates Archive, we used an automated
					<a href="https://github.com/jmbatrina/CS132-RBC/blob/main/data/meralco_rates-archives_download.py"
						style="color: blue; text-decoration: none;">
						script</a>
					from
					<a href="https://jmbatrina.github.io/CS132-RBC/" style="color: blue; text-decoration: none;">
						MeralCOST</a>
					, a project in the 2023-2024 iteration of CS 132, by Team R.B.C.
					This includes data from 2010 to 2024.

					<h2>Methods</h2>
				</header>

				<h3>Data Preprocessing</h3>

				<p>
					Most of the Meralco data had already been cleaned by Team R.B.C,
					hence we only needed to preprocess the more recent Meralco Rates.
					We dropped unnecessary columns in the dataset and kept the most
					relevant ones such as the <code>Total Bill per kWh</code>.
					<br> <br>
					The NCR Pump Prices data from 2020 to 2023 does not contain the
					summary information unlike the more recent datasets. Hence we
					first converted the entire table into a CSV. This gave us the
					raw data of gas prices from the cities in the NCR. Unfortunately,
					some of the weeks in the dataset were missing. Thus, we interpolated
					the missing weeks such that each price entry was within 10 days
					from each other.

					Afterwards, we summarized the data in these CSV files to keep
					consistent with the summarized data from 2024 and 2025.

					Finally, we aggregated the entries to be by month in order to
					be on par with the Meralco rates.

					To address missing common price data in earlier gas dataset entries, we opted to calculate an
					average price using the minimum and maximum recorded prices. This average then served as our
					reference point for the overall comparison.
				</p>

				<h3>Data Visualization</h3>

				We plotted the datasets of the NCR Gas Prices and Meralco Rates and showed the corresponding regression
				line.

				<iframe class="graph" src="data/graphs/electricity_cost_400kWh.html" frameborder="0"></iframe>

				To compare overall fuel efficiency, we analyzed the average city driving efficiencies of the top 10 ICE,
				HEV, and EV cars in the Philippines. We primarily used manufacturer-claimed figures for individual car
				fuel efficiency, with source details available in our dataset sheets. The following boxplot illustrates
				the fuel efficiency distribution for each vehicle category.

				<iframe class="graph" src="data/graphs/fuelenergyefficiency_boxplot.html" frameborder="0"></iframe>

				<h3>Hypothesis Testing</h3>
				<p>
					We used the Kruskal-Wallis Test to check for seasonality of the datasets. This is a non-parametric
					test that compares the medians of two or more groups of data to determine if at least one of the
					medians are different from the others. In this case, we applied it to the gas prices, meralco rates,
					and the difference in cost/km from using an avg HEV compared to avg EV. We checked for seasonality
					by months, seasons (dry and wet), and years.

				<h3>Cost Comparison: EV vs. HEV per Kilometer</h3>
				<p>Combining our data, the overall comparison highlights the average cost to drive one kilometer with an
					electric vehicle (EV) versus a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). As the graph indicates, the cost of
					charging an EV consistently remains lower than the gasoline expenses for an HEV.
				</p>

				<iframe class="graph" src="data/graphs/gas_vs_electricity.html" frameborder="0"></iframe>

				<p>
					To provide context for the trends in gas and electricity prices, we've also included major events
					from 2020 to 2024. For
					instance, the sharp decline in gas prices starting in April 2020 likely correlates with the Luzon
					ECQ lockdown and reduced vehicle traffic. Similarly, the significant increase in gas costs around
					March
					2022 may be attributed to the onset of the Russia-Ukraine War. Finally, the notable drop in
					electricity
					costs in June 2024 can be explained by the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) Order issued in direct
					response to the recent surges days with high heat index.
				</p>

				<h3>Hypothesis Test Results</h3>
				<p>
					Our hypothesis test revealed statistically significant yearly seasonality in the data, while the
					monthly
					and by season (dry and wet) seasonality were not statistically significant. Hence, we
					fail to reject the initial null hypothesis, suggesting that the time of year significantly
					influences
					the cost difference between HEV and EV usage.

					Looking back at the regression lines of the gas plot and
					electricity plot, the yearly seasonality indicates a consistent
