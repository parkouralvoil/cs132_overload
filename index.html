					<h2>Overview</h2>
				</header>

				<p>In April of 2022, the Electric Vehicle Industry Development Act (EVIDA) took effect in the
					Philippines, unleashing electric vehicles (EVs) into our everyday city streets. While EVs are not
					particularly new, mainstream pioneering models such as those from Tesla have historically been
					priced higher than traditional gas-based vehicles, making them more of a luxury than a practical
					alternative for many. However, as this emerging technology advances toward economies of scale — and
					public awareness increasingly embraces climate change and energy sustainability — manufacturers and
					institutions are beginning to regard EVs as the next logical step in the evolution of automobile
					transport. From new players like BYD to established giants like Toyota, today’s EV market is not
					only more diverse, but also increasingly affordable. This begs the question: with their lower
					upfront cost, are EVs now more cost-effective than traditional gas cars or even Hybrid Electric
					Vehicles (HEVs)?

				</p>

				<h3>Background</h3>

				<div class="background_photo">
					<img src="images/ev_photo.jpg" alt="DoE photo" class="responsive-image">
				</div>
				<p>Republic Act No. 11697, otherwise known as the Electric Vehicles Industry Development Act, took
					effect on April 15, 2022. It was enacted to reduce the country's reliance on imported fossil fuels,
					support clean energy, and foster industrialization. It provides incentives for electric vehicle
					purchasing and ownership such as the following:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>exemption from number coding schemes<sup>2</sup></li>
					<li>discounts for the Motor Vehicle User's Charge (MVUC) for 8 years<sup>3</sup></li>
					<li>priority registration of special EV license plates<sup>3</sup></li>
					<li>various other tax incentives</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Problem</h3>
				<p>
					Since EVs recharge through wall sockets while gas cars refuel at station pumps, a method of directly
					comparing cost-effectiveness between them may not be immediately intuitive. Still, EVs are
					frequently marketed to be more sustainable than internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, leading
					many to the generally accurate assumption that EVs are more “fuel” efficient than ICE cars. However,
					the consensus is not as clear when comparing EVs to Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs), with HEVs
					themselves also being marketed for their fuel efficiency. Instead of relying solely on an electric
					motor or an ICE, HEVs use both — typically the electric motor at lower speeds with the ICE
					supporting at higher speeds. Some HEVs are refueled solely through gasoline, with the ICE simply
					charging the battery that powers the electric motor; others can be both pumped or charged, offering
					even greater flexibility. This can lead to the perception that HEVs enjoy the best of both worlds,
					utilizing either technologies only for their ideal use cases.
				</p>
				<p style="background-color: #eff3b0; /* AliceBlue */

				border: 1px solid #000000;">
					<strong>This evolves the question: as electric vehicles steal the spotlight, are hybrid vehicles
						secretly
						the more practical pick for savings-oriented drivers? </strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					How do HEVs compare against fully electric vehicles in terms of cost-effectiveness? Perhaps there
					are scenarios where gasoline itself becomes significantly more economical than electricity — for
					instance, during periods of higher electricity demand and rates, like during the dry season in the
					Philippines. Considering the current limitations in public EV charging infrastructure within the
					Philippines, our cost comparison will focus on home-based EV charging using Meralco rates versus the
					cost of refueling HEVs at gasoline stations within the National Capital Region (NCR).

					<h2>Data</h2>
				</header>

				<p>We gathered most of our data from these sites:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://company.meralco.com.ph/news-and-advisories/rates-archives"
							style="color: green; text-decoration: none;">MERALCO Rates Archive</a>
					</li>
					<li><a href="https://doe.gov.ph/retail-pump-prices-metro-manila"
							style="color: green; text-decoration: none;">NCR Prevailing Retail Pump Prices | Department
							of Energy Philippines</a>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					To scrape the data from the MERALCO Rates Archive, we used an automated
					<a href="https://github.com/jmbatrina/CS132-RBC/blob/main/data/meralco_rates-archives_download.py"
						style="color: blue; text-decoration: none;">
						script</a>
					from
					<a href="https://jmbatrina.github.io/CS132-RBC/" style="color: blue; text-decoration: none;">
						MeralCOST</a>
					, a project in the 2023-2024 iteration of CS 132, by Team R.B.C.
					This includes data from 2010 to 2024.

					<h2>Methods</h2>
				</header>

				<h3>Data Preprocessing</h3>

				<p>
					Most of the Meralco data had already been cleaned by Team R.B.C,
					hence we only needed to preprocess the more recent Meralco Rates.
					We dropped unnecessary columns in the dataset and kept the most
					relevant ones such as the <code>Total Bill per kWh</code>.
					<br> <br>
					The NCR Pump Prices data from 2020 to 2023 does not contain the
					summary information unlike the more recent datasets. Hence we
					first converted the entire table into a CSV. This gave us the
					raw data of gas prices from the cities in the NCR. Unfortunately,
					some of the weeks in the dataset were missing. Thus, we interpolated
					the missing weeks such that each price entry was within 10 days
					from each other.

					Afterwards, we summarized the data in these CSV files to keep
					consistent with the summarized data from 2024 and 2025.

					Finally, we aggregated the entries to be by month in order to
					be on par with the Meralco rates.

					To address missing common price data in earlier gas dataset entries, we opted to calculate an
					average price using the minimum and maximum recorded prices. This average then served as our
					reference point for the overall comparison.
				</p>

				<h3>Data Visualization</h3>

				We plotted the datasets of the NCR Gas Prices and Meralco Rates and showed the corresponding regression
				line.
				<iframe class="graph" src="data/graphs/gasoline_price_trends.html" frameborder="0"></iframe>
				<iframe class="graph" src="data/graphs/electricity_cost_400kWh.html" frameborder="0"></iframe>

				To compare overall fuel efficiency, we analyzed the average city driving efficiencies of the top 10 ICE,
				HEV, and EV cars in the Philippines. We primarily used manufacturer-claimed figures for individual car
				fuel efficiency, with source details available in our dataset sheets. The following boxplot illustrates
				the fuel efficiency distribution for each vehicle category.

				<iframe class="graph" src="data/graphs/fuelenergyefficiency_boxplot.html" frameborder="0"></iframe>

				<h3>Hypothesis Testing</h3>
				<p>
					We used the Kruskal-Wallis Test to check for seasonality of the datasets. This is a non-parametric
					test that compares the medians of two or more groups of data to determine if at least one of the
					medians are different from the others. In this case, we applied it to the gas prices, meralco rates,
					and the difference in cost/km from using an average HEV compared to an average EV. We checked for
					seasonality
					by months, seasons (dry and wet), and years.

				<h3>Cost Comparison: EV vs. HEV per Kilometer</h3>
				<p>Combining our data, the overall comparison highlights the average cost to drive one kilometer with an
					electric vehicle (EV) versus a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV).


				</p>

				<iframe class="graph" src="data/graphs/gas_vs_electricity.html" frameborder="0"></iframe>

				<p>
					To provide context for the trends in gas and electricity prices, we've also included major events
					from 2020 to 2024. For
					instance, the sharp decline in gas prices starting in April 2020 likely correlates with the Luzon
					ECQ lockdown and reduced vehicle traffic. Similarly, the significant increase in gas costs around
					March
					2022 may be attributed to the onset of the Russia-Ukraine War. Finally, the notable drop in
					electricity
					costs in June 2024 can be explained by the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) Order issued in direct
					response to the recent surges days with high heat index.
				</p>

				<h3>Hypothesis Test Results</h3>
				<p>
					Meanwhile, our hypothesis test revealed statistically significant yearly seasonality in the data,
					while the
					monthly and by season (dry and wet) seasonality were not statistically significant.
					Hence, we fail to reject the initial null hypothesis, suggesting that the time of year
					significantly influences the cost difference between HEV and EV usage.

				<h3>Machine Learning for Prediction</h3>
				<p>
					We used Meta's Prophet forecasting model to create the time series forecasts for gas and
					electricity. For both datasets, we decided to exclude the 2020 to 2022 data as this period's
					pandemic conditions could skew the results. The Prophet model was initialized with yearly
					seasonality set to true. We focused on predicting the prices up until the end of 2025.
				</p>
				<iframe class="graph" src="data/graphs/future_gas.html"></iframe>
				<iframe class="graph" src="data/graphs/future_gas_components.html"></iframe>
				<p>
					The results from the gas predictions indicates a seasonal dip as January approaches, followed by a
					climb until June. The overall forecast suggests a downward trend in gas prices from 2022 to the end
					of 2025.
				</p>
				Comparing the results of the regression line from 2020 to 2024 compared to the gas predictions indicates
				two possible views:
				<ol>
					<li>
						A regression line fitted to our data from 2020 to 2024 indicates an increasing trend.
					</li>
					<li>On the other hand, the Prophet forecasting model projects a decreasing trend in gas prices for
						the
						period of 2022 to 2025. This difference may suggest a shift in the expected long-term trajectory
						that the forecasting model is identifying.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<iframe class="graph" src="data/graphs/future_meralco.html" frameborder="0"></iframe>
				<iframe class="graph" src="data/graphs/future_meralco_components.html" frameborder="0"></iframe>
				<p>
					Focusing on the predictions for the Meralco rates, the drop on June 2024 due to the ERC order could
					have heavily influenced the prediction to assume that another sudden price drop might happen in June
					2025. Overall it shows that there is an upward trend from 2022 to the end of 2025, with the increase
					slowing down by July 2023.
				</p>
				</ol>
				<iframe class="graph" src="data/graphs/future_gas_vs_electricity.html" frameborder="0"></iframe>
				<p>
					Putting the prediction results to the comparison graph for gas vs electricity cost per km, we see
					that it electricity still remains cheaper up to the end of 2025.

					<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				</header>

				<h3>Limitations and Further Study</h3>

				<p>
					At present, since the study selected only the top 10 gasoline, HEV, and EV cars in
					the Philippines, further research can explore a more diverse and larger set of automobiles
					to have more generalizable results. Additionally, it would be better to be able to
					have a more uniform source for fuel efficiencies since at present, the study relied
					on the manufacturer. Future explorations may even consider calculating costs beyond
					just fuel efficiency, such as accounting for average travel speed.
				</p>

				<p>
					Future studies can even go further and incorporate other costs into consideration
					such as buying price or maintenance cost in order to better inform Filipinos on the
					potential financial benefits or drawbacks. For example, while EVs may be more cost
					efficient, would the price difference be significant enough for Filipinos to decide
					against buying? How long would it take for the EV cost efficiency to cover the cost
					of the buying price difference?
				</p>

				<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>
				<p>While HEVs may pose certain benefits in terms of flexibility, the data does not lie: the selected EVs
					are the more long-term cost-effective option for NCR driving during any time of year. Noteworthy as
					well is that the cost gap has even dramatically increased over time, with our regression analysis
					suggesting that this clear gap will persist even into the near future. Beyond the benefits which
					R.A. No. 11697, these results are evidence that electric vehicles are more efficient even in a
					policy vacuum — meaning that as incentives expire, benefits will not necessarily dwindle with time.
				</p>

				<p>Our hypothesis testing further clarifies that gas and electricity prices only significantly differ
					over yearly intervals, alluding to rising prices from year to year. While these price differences
					may be influenced by global events on a yearly timescale, it is concretely revealed that price
					differences depending on certain months or seasons of the year are not meaningful enough.
					Practically, this means that even with electricity price increases during the summer months, EVs
					would still be more cost effective.
				</p>

				<h3>Call to Action</h3>
				<p style="background-color: #efecb9; /* AliceBlue */
				padding: 20px;
				border-radius: 10px;
				border: 1px solid #000000;">
					As initially mentioned, EVs were once perceived to be a luxury, typically reserved for progressives
					within first world countries who could afford their premium price tag. However, as electric vehicles
					become more accessible, it is now apparent that we are approaching a point where lowering our carbon
					footprint and contributing to energy sustainability no longer entails some form of personal
					sacrifice in service of a greater communal good. This study suggests that it is now simply logical
					from even a personal standpoint to participate in the shift to electric vehicles, as we stand to
					economically benefit not only from the policy-based incentives, but from the simple math of supply
					and demand. It is now a better time than ever to purchase your first electric vehicle, backed both
					by short-term policy benefits and long-term economic savings, as well as the peace of mind in
					knowing you are helping build a better and more secure environment for tomorrow.
